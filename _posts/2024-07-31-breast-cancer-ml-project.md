### Introduction

This is a machine learning project that utilizes a breast cancer dataset to predict a diagnosis of the cancer (whether or not its malignant or benign) based on the physical characteristics of the cancer. This project was a final project for one of my machine learning classes that I took this past spring semester. I have since taken the project further than that final project to teach myself even more about machine learning.
