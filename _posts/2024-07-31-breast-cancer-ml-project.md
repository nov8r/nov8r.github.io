## Breast Cancer ML Project

As a final project for a machine learning class I took at the end of my Junior year, we were required to take all our skills that we learned from the previous semester and build our own project.

This required us to find a dataset, preprocess all the data and clean it, train our models, etc. For this project I found a fairly well known breast cancer dataset.
